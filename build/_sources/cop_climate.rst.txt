Copernicus Climate Change Service
============================================

.. Climate change is the large-scale, long-term shift in weather patterns driven by changes in average temperatures. Evidence for climate change includes:

..  * **higher temperatures**
..  * changing rainfall patterns
..  * rising average sea-levels
..  * melting of glaciers and ice-sheets
..  * more frequent extreme weather events

The `Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) <https://climate.copernicus.eu>`_ *“has been designed to respond to environmental and societal challenges associated with climate change”*.

The C3S aims at combining expertise from across Europe by providing key indicators on climate change drivers and impacts to support the `European climate change policy <https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/eu-climate-action_en>`_. The C3S leverages a systematical use of in-situ and satellite-based observations, combined with climate models, to generate these indicators. The C3S web portal further open access to climate datasets, information and news [1]_.

Climate Data Store
------------------------------------

The `Climate Data Store (CDS) <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home>`_ is one of the component of the C3S web portal and provide access to the geophysical information needed to analyse the Climate Change Indicators in a consistent, scientific manner. Users can `register for free <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/user/register>`_ to obtain access to the CDS and its Toolbox.

The CDS provides:

 * estimates of essential climate variables, climate indicators, and relevant information
 * near-real time climate monitoring facility
 * access to multi-model seasonal forecasts
 * climate projections at global and regional scales
 * access to research computing facilities
 * data processing and visualisation tools

.. note::

   In the hands-on exercise, you will download air temperature data from the CDS for the city of Milan and you will learn how to manipulate them in QGIS.
